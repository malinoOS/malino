# malino project - acknowledgments

The toolkit application uses [spinner](https://github.com/briandowns/spinner) for progress indicators.

It also uses [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery) for downloading the latest Linux kernel.

And yes, while we do make fun of [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos) ALOT, we have nothing against the project and it's developers.

# malino project - code of conduct

There are people who don't want to read 20 pages consisting of text walls, so here's a list.

- `treat others with respect` - Harassment or trolling isn't allowed. Demotivating others isn't allowed. Keep criticism constructive. We want malino's community to be a place to share ideas and projects. Not a toxic wasteland.

- `no nsfw or gore` - NSFW or gore will not be tolerated in any form. This includes making jokes relating to these topics.

- `respect differing opinions` - Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and perspectives. Disagreements are natural, but avoid personal attacks or hostile behavior.
